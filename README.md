# Kubernetes Resource Provider

The Kubernetes resource provider for Pulumi lets you use Kubernetes resources in your cloud programs.

This package is meant for use with the Pulumi CLI.  Please visit [pulumi.io](https://pulumi.io) for
installation instructions.

## Kubernetes version support

The `pulumi-kubernetes` package closely tracks the latest upstream release, and provides access
to the full API surface, including deprecated endpoints. At a minimum, we support the current version
and the previous two versions. Older versions will likely work as well, but are not officially supported.

See the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for details
on supported versions of Kubernetes for each version of the `pulumi-kubernetes` package.
