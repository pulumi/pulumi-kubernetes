/**
 * Patch resources are used to modify existing Kubernetes resources by using
 * Server-Side Apply updates. The name of the resource must be specified, but all other properties are optional. More than
 * one patch may be applied to the same resource, and a random FieldManager name will be used for each Patch resource.
 * Conflicts will result in an error by default, but can be forced using the "pulumi.com/patchForce" annotation. See the
 * [Server-Side Apply Docs](https://www.pulumi.com/registry/packages/kubernetes/installation-configuration/#server-side-apply) for
 * additional information about using Server-Side Apply to manage Kubernetes resources with Pulumi.
 * Deployment enables declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets.
 *
 * This resource waits until its status is ready before registering success
 * for create/update, and populating output properties from the current state of the resource.
 * The following conditions are used to determine whether the resource creation has
 * succeeded or failed:
 *
 * 1. The Deployment has begun to be updated by the Deployment controller. If the current
 *    generation of the Deployment is > 1, then this means that the current generation must
 *    be different from the generation reported by the last outputs.
 * 2. There exists a ReplicaSet whose revision is equal to the current revision of the
 *    Deployment.
 * 3. The Deployment's '.status.conditions' has a status of type 'Available' whose 'status'
 *    member is set to 'True'.
 * 4. If the Deployment has generation > 1, then '.status.conditions' has a status of type
 *    'Progressing', whose 'status' member is set to 'True', and whose 'reason' is
 *    'NewReplicaSetAvailable'. For generation <= 1, this status field does not exist,
 *    because it doesn't do a rollout (i.e., it simply creates the Deployment and
 *    corresponding ReplicaSet), and therefore there is no rollout to mark as 'Progressing'.
 *
 * If the Deployment has not reached a Ready state after 10 minutes, it will
 * time out and mark the resource update as Failed. You can override the default timeout value
 * by setting the 'customTimeouts' option on the resource.
 *
 * @deprecated apps/v1beta1/Deployment is deprecated by apps/v1/Deployment and not supported by Kubernetes v1.16+ clusters.
