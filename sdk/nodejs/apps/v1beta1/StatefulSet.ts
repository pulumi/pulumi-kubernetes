     * @deprecated apps/v1beta1/StatefulSet is not supported by Kubernetes 1.16+ clusters. Use
     * apps/v1/StatefulSet instead.
     * 
     * StatefulSet represents a set of pods with consistent identities. Identities are defined as:
     *  - Network: A single stable DNS and hostname.
     *  - Storage: As many VolumeClaims as requested.
     * The StatefulSet guarantees that a given network identity will always map to the same storage
     * identity.
     * 
     * This resource waits until its status is ready before registering success
     * for create/update, and populating output properties from the current state of the resource.
     * The following conditions are used to determine whether the resource creation has
     * succeeded or failed:
     * 
     * 1. The value of 'spec.replicas' matches '.status.replicas', '.status.currentReplicas',
     *    and '.status.readyReplicas'.
     * 2. The value of '.status.updateRevision' matches '.status.currentRevision'.
     * 
     * If the StatefulSet has not reached a Ready state after 10 minutes, it will
     * time out and mark the resource update as Failed. You can override the default timeout value
     * by setting the 'customTimeouts' option on the resource.
