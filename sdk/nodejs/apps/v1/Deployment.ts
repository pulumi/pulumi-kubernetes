       * 1. &#39;.metadata.annotations[&#34;deployment.kubernetes.io/revision&#34;]&#39; in the current Deployment
       *   must have been incremented by the Deployment controller, i.e., it must not be equal to
       *   the revision number in the previous outputs. This number is used to indicate the the
       *   active ReplicaSet. Any time a change is made to the Deployment&#39;s Pod template, this
       *   revision is incremented, and a new ReplicaSet is created with a corresponding revision
       *   number in its own annotations. This condition overall is a test to make sure that the
       *   Deployment controller is making progress in rolling forward to the new generation.
       * 
       * 2. &#39;.status.conditions&#39; has a status with &#39;type&#39; equal to &#39;Progressing&#39;, a &#39;status&#39; set to
       *   &#39;True&#39;, and a &#39;reason&#39; set to &#39;NewReplicaSetAvailable&#39;. Though the condition is called
       *   &#34;Progressing&#34;, this condition indicates that the new ReplicaSet has become healthy and
       *   available, and the Deployment controller is now free to delete the old ReplicaSet.
       * 
       * 3. &#39;.status.conditions&#39; has a status with &#39;type&#39; equal to &#39;Available&#39;, a &#39;status&#39; equal to
       *   &#39;True&#39;. If the Deployment is not available, we should fail the Deployment immediately.
       * 
       * @param name The _unique_ name of the resource.
