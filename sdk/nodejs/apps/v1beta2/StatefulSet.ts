/**
 * StatefulSet represents a set of pods with consistent identities. Identities are defined as:
 *  - Network: A single stable DNS and hostname.
 *  - Storage: As many VolumeClaims as requested.
 * The StatefulSet guarantees that a given network identity will always map to the same storage identity.
 *
 * This resource waits until its status is ready before registering success
 * for create/update, and populating output properties from the current state of the resource.
 * The following conditions are used to determine whether the resource creation has
 * succeeded or failed:
 *
 * 1. The value of 'spec.replicas' matches '.status.replicas', '.status.currentReplicas',
 *    and '.status.readyReplicas'.
 * 2. The value of '.status.updateRevision' matches '.status.currentRevision'.
 *
 * If the StatefulSet has not reached a Ready state after 10 minutes, it will
 * time out and mark the resource update as Failed. You can override the default timeout value
 * by setting the 'customTimeouts' option on the resource.
 *
 * @deprecated apps/v1beta2/StatefulSet is deprecated by apps/v1/StatefulSet and not supported by Kubernetes v1.16+ clusters.
