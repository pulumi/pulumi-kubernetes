             *
             * Equality on arrays with list type of 'set' or 'map' ignores element order, i.e. [1, 2] == [2, 1]. Concatenation on arrays with x-kubernetes-list-type use the semantics of the list type:
             *   - 'set': `X + Y` performs a union where the array positions of all elements in `X` are preserved and
             *     non-intersecting elements in `Y` are appended, retaining their partial order.
             *   - 'map': `X + Y` performs a merge where the array positions of all keys in `X` are preserved but the values
             *     are overwritten by values in `Y` when the key sets of `X` and `Y` intersect. Elements in `Y` with

             * Please note that using `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` as a `host` is risky unless you take great care to run this webhook on all hosts which run an apiserver which might need to make calls to this webhook. Such installs are likely to be non-portable, i.e., not easy to turn up in a new cluster.

The `self` variable in the CEL expression is bound to the scoped value. Example: - Rule scoped to the root of a resource with a status subresource: {"rule": "self.status.actual <= self.spec.maxDesired"}
             *
             * If the Rule is scoped to an object with properties, the accessible properties of the object are field selectable via `self.field` and field presence can be checked via `has(self.field)`. Null valued fields are treated as absent fields in CEL expressions. If the Rule is scoped to an object with additionalProperties (i.e. a map) the value of the map are accessible via `self[mapKey]`, map containment can be checked via `mapKey in self` and all entries of the map are accessible via CEL macros and functions such as `self.all(...)`. If the Rule is scoped to an array, the elements of the array are accessible via `self[i]` and also by macros and functions. If the Rule is scoped to a scalar, `self` is bound to the scalar value. Examples: - Rule scoped to a map of objects: {"rule": "self.components['Widget'].priority < 10"} - Rule scoped to a list of integers: {"rule": "self.values.all(value, value >= 0 && value < 100)"} - Rule scoped to a string value: {"rule": "self.startsWith('kube')"}
             *
             * The `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata.name` and `metadata.generateName` are always accessible from the root of the object and from any x-kubernetes-embedded-resource annotated objects. No other metadata properties are accessible.
             *
             * Unknown data preserved in custom resources via x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields is not accessible in CEL expressions. This includes: - Unknown field values that are preserved by object schemas with x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields. - Object properties where the property schema is of an "unknown type". An "unknown type" is recursively defined as:
             *   - A schema with no type and x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields set to true
             *   - An array where the items schema is of an "unknown type"
             *   - An object where the additionalProperties schema is of an "unknown type"
             *
             * Only property names of the form `[a-zA-Z_.-/][a-zA-Z0-9_.-/]*` are accessible. Accessible property names are escaped according to the following rules when accessed in the expression: - '__' escapes to '__underscores__' - '.' escapes to '__dot__' - '-' escapes to '__dash__' - '/' escapes to '__slash__' - Property names that exactly match a CEL RESERVED keyword escape to '__{keyword}__'. The keywords are:
             * 	  "true", "false", "null", "in", "as", "break", "const", "continue", "else", "for", "function", "if",
             * 	  "import", "let", "loop", "package", "namespace", "return".
             * Examples:
             *   - Rule accessing a property named "namespace": {"rule": "self.__namespace__ > 0"}
             *   - Rule accessing a property named "x-prop": {"rule": "self.x__dash__prop > 0"}
             *   - Rule accessing a property named "redact__d": {"rule": "self.redact__underscores__d > 0"}
             *
             * Equality on arrays with x-kubernetes-list-type of 'set' or 'map' ignores element order, i.e. [1, 2] == [2, 1]. Concatenation on arrays with x-kubernetes-list-type use the semantics of the list type:
             *   - 'set': `X + Y` performs a union where the array positions of all elements in `X` are preserved and
             *     non-intersecting elements in `Y` are appended, retaining their partial order.
             *   - 'map': `X + Y` performs a merge where the array positions of all keys in `X` are preserved but the values
             *     are overwritten by values in `Y` when the key sets of `X` and `Y` intersect. Elements in `Y` with
             *     non-intersecting keys are appended, retaining their partial order.
             *
             * If `rule` makes use of the `oldSelf` variable it is implicitly a `transition rule`.
             *
             * By default, the `oldSelf` variable is the same type as `self`. When `optionalOldSelf` is true, the `oldSelf` variable is a CEL optional
             *  variable whose value() is the same type as `self`.
             * See the documentation for the `optionalOldSelf` field for details.
             *
             * Transition rules by default are applied only on UPDATE requests and are skipped if an old value could not be found. You can opt a transition rule into unconditional evaluation by setting `optionalOldSelf` to true.

            /**
             * Rule represents the expression which will be evaluated by CEL. ref: https://github.com/google/cel-spec The Rule is scoped to the location of the x-kubernetes-validations extension in the schema. The `self` variable in the CEL expression is bound to the scoped value. Example: - Rule scoped to the root of a resource with a status subresource: {"rule": "self.status.actual <= self.spec.maxDesired"}
             *
             * If the Rule is scoped to an object with properties, the accessible properties of the object are field selectable via `self.field` and field presence can be checked via `has(self.field)`. Null valued fields are treated as absent fields in CEL expressions. If the Rule is scoped to an object with additionalProperties (i.e. a map) the value of the map are accessible via `self[mapKey]`, map containment can be checked via `mapKey in self` and all entries of the map are accessible via CEL macros and functions such as `self.all(...)`. If the Rule is scoped to an array, the elements of the array are accessible via `self[i]` and also by macros and functions. If the Rule is scoped to a scalar, `self` is bound to the scalar value. Examples: - Rule scoped to a map of objects: {"rule": "self.components['Widget'].priority < 10"} - Rule scoped to a list of integers: {"rule": "self.values.all(value, value >= 0 && value < 100)"} - Rule scoped to a string value: {"rule": "self.startsWith('kube')"}
             *
             * The `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata.name` and `metadata.generateName` are always accessible from the root of the object and from any x-kubernetes-embedded-resource annotated objects. No other metadata properties are accessible.
             *
             * Unknown data preserved in custom resources via x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields is not accessible in CEL expressions. This includes: - Unknown field values that are preserved by object schemas with x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields. - Object properties where the property schema is of an "unknown type". An "unknown type" is recursively defined as:
             *   - A schema with no type and x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields set to true
             *   - An array where the items schema is of an "unknown type"
             *   - An object where the additionalProperties schema is of an "unknown type"
             *
             * Only property names of the form `[a-zA-Z_.-/][a-zA-Z0-9_.-/]*` are accessible. Accessible property names are escaped according to the following rules when accessed in the expression: - '__' escapes to '__underscores__' - '.' escapes to '__dot__' - '-' escapes to '__dash__' - '/' escapes to '__slash__' - Property names that exactly match a CEL RESERVED keyword escape to '__{keyword}__'. The keywords are:
             * 	  "true", "false", "null", "in", "as", "break", "const", "continue", "else", "for", "function", "if",
             * 	  "import", "let", "loop", "package", "namespace", "return".
             * Examples:
             *   - Rule accessing a property named "namespace": {"rule": "self.__namespace__ > 0"}
             *   - Rule accessing a property named "x-prop": {"rule": "self.x__dash__prop > 0"}
             *   - Rule accessing a property named "redact__d": {"rule": "self.redact__underscores__d > 0"}
             *
             * Equality on arrays with x-kubernetes-list-type of 'set' or 'map' ignores element order, i.e. [1, 2] == [2, 1]. Concatenation on arrays with x-kubernetes-list-type use the semantics of the list type:
             *   - 'set': `X + Y` performs a union where the array positions of all elements in `X` are preserved and
             *     non-intersecting elements in `Y` are appended, retaining their partial order.
             *   - 'map': `X + Y` performs a merge where the array positions of all keys in `X` are preserved but the values
             *     are overwritten by values in `Y` when the key sets of `X` and `Y` intersect. Elements in `Y` with
             *     non-intersecting keys are appended, retaining their partial order.
             *
             * If `rule` makes use of the `oldSelf` variable it is implicitly a `transition rule`.
             *
             * By default, the `oldSelf` variable is the same type as `self`. When `optionalOldSelf` is true, the `oldSelf` variable is a CEL optional
             *  variable whose value() is the same type as `self`.
             * See the documentation for the `optionalOldSelf` field for details.
             *
             * Transition rules by default are applied only on UPDATE requests and are skipped if an old value could not be found. You can opt a transition rule into unconditional evaluation by setting `optionalOldSelf` to true.

         *    Deployment.
         * 3. The Deployment's '.status.conditions' has a status of type 'Available' whose 'status'
         *    member is set to 'True'.

         *    'NewReplicaSetAvailable'. For generation <= 1, this status field does not exist,
         *    because it doesn't do a rollout (i.e., it simply creates the Deployment and
         *    corresponding ReplicaSet), and therefore there is no rollout to mark as 'Progressing'.
         *
         * If the Deployment has not reached a Ready state after 10 minutes, it will
         * time out and mark the resource update as Failed. You can override the default timeout value

Once new pods are ready, old ReplicaSet can be scaled down further, followed by scaling up the new ReplicaSet, ensuring that the total number of pods available at all times during the update is at least 70% of desired pods.

When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic provisioner. This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef, both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty. When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef, dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty. There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef: * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
             *   allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
             * * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
             *   preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
             *   specified.
             * * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
             *   in any namespaces.
