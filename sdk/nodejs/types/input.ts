             *   matches /foo/bar/baz, but does not match /foo/barbaz).
             * * ImplementationSpecific: Interpretation of the Path matching is up to
             *   the IngressClass. Implementations can treat this as a separate PathType
             *   or treat it identically to Prefix or Exact path types.
