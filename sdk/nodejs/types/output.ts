If the Rule is scoped to an object with additionalProperties (i.e. a map) the value of the map are accessible via `self[mapKey]`, map containment can be checked via `mapKey in self` and all entries of the map are accessible via CEL macros and functions such as `self.all(...)`. If the Rule is scoped to an array, the elements of the array are accessible via `self[i]` and also by macros and functions. If the Rule is scoped to a scalar, `self` is bound to the scalar value.

         *    'NewReplicaSetAvailable'. For generation <= 1, this status field does not exist,
         *    because it doesn't do a rollout (i.e., it simply creates the Deployment and
         *    corresponding ReplicaSet), and therefore there is no rollout to mark as 'Progressing'.

         * time out and mark the resource update as Failed. You can override the default timeout value

             *  2. All PEM blocks must have the "CERTIFICATE" label, contain no headers, and the encoded data
             *   must be a BER-encoded ASN.1 Certificate structure as described in section 4 of RFC5280.
             *  3. Non-PEM content may appear before or after the "CERTIFICATE" PEM blocks and is unvalidated,
             *   to allow for explanatory text as described in section 5.2 of RFC7468.
             *
             * If more than one PEM block is present, and the definition of the requested spec.signerName does not indicate otherwise, the first block is the issued certificate, and subsequent blocks should be treated as intermediate certificates and presented in TLS handshakes.
             *
             * The certificate is encoded in PEM format.
             *
