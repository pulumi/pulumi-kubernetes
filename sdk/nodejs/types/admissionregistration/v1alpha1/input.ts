    /**
     * Expression represents the expression which will be evaluated by CEL. ref: https://github.com/google/cel-spec CEL expressions have access to the contents of the Admission request/response, organized into CEL variables as well as some other useful variables:
     *
     * 'object' - The object from the incoming request. The value is null for DELETE requests. 'oldObject' - The existing object. The value is null for CREATE requests. 'request' - Attributes of the admission request([ref](/pkg/apis/admission/types.go#AdmissionRequest)). 'params' - Parameter resource referred to by the policy binding being evaluated. Only populated if the policy has a ParamKind.
     *
     * The `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata.name` and `metadata.generateName` are always accessible from the root of the object. No other metadata properties are accessible.
     *
     * Only property names of the form `[a-zA-Z_.-/][a-zA-Z0-9_.-/]*` are accessible. Accessible property names are escaped according to the following rules when accessed in the expression: - '__' escapes to '__underscores__' - '.' escapes to '__dot__' - '-' escapes to '__dash__' - '/' escapes to '__slash__' - Property names that exactly match a CEL RESERVED keyword escape to '__{keyword}__'. The keywords are:
     * 	  "true", "false", "null", "in", "as", "break", "const", "continue", "else", "for", "function", "if",
     * 	  "import", "let", "loop", "package", "namespace", "return".
     * Examples:
     *   - Expression accessing a property named "namespace": {"Expression": "object.__namespace__ > 0"}
     *   - Expression accessing a property named "x-prop": {"Expression": "object.x__dash__prop > 0"}
     *   - Expression accessing a property named "redact__d": {"Expression": "object.redact__underscores__d > 0"}
     *
     * Equality on arrays with list type of 'set' or 'map' ignores element order, i.e. [1, 2] == [2, 1]. Concatenation on arrays with x-kubernetes-list-type use the semantics of the list type:
     *   - 'set': `X + Y` performs a union where the array positions of all elements in `X` are preserved and
     *     non-intersecting elements in `Y` are appended, retaining their partial order.
     *   - 'map': `X + Y` performs a merge where the array positions of all keys in `X` are preserved but the values
     *     are overwritten by values in `Y` when the key sets of `X` and `Y` intersect. Elements in `Y` with
     *     non-intersecting keys are appended, retaining their partial order.
     * Required.
