    /**
     * Pod is a collection of containers that can run on a host. This resource is created by clients
     * and scheduled onto hosts.
     * 
     * This resource waits until it is ready before registering success for
     * create/update and populating output properties from the current state of the resource.
     * The following conditions are used to determine whether the resource creation has
     * succeeded or failed:
     * 1. The Pod is scheduled ("PodScheduled"" '.status.condition' is true).
     * 2. The Pod is initialized ("Initialized" '.status.condition' is true).
     * 3. The Pod is ready ("Ready" '.status.condition' is true) and the '.status.phase' is
     *    set to "Running".
     * Or (for Jobs): The Pod succeeded ('.status.phase' set to "Succeeded").
     * 
     * If the Pod has not reached a Ready state after 5 minutes, it will
     * time out and mark the resource update as Failed. You can override the default timeout value
     * by setting 'pulumi.com/timeoutSeconds' as a '.metadata.annotation' on the resource.
     * This approach will be deprecated in favor of customTimeouts. See
     * https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-kubernetes/issues/672 for details.
