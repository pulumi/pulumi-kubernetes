 * Endpoints is a collection of endpoints that implement the actual service. Example:
 *
 *      Name: "mysvc",
 *      Subsets: [
 *        {
 *          Addresses: [{"ip": "10.10.1.1"}, {"ip": "10.10.2.2"}],
 *          Ports: [{"name": "a", "port": 8675}, {"name": "b", "port": 309}]
 *        },
 *        {
 *          Addresses: [{"ip": "10.10.3.3"}],
 *          Ports: [{"name": "a", "port": 93}, {"name": "b", "port": 76}]
 *        },
 *     ]
 *
 * Endpoints is a legacy API and does not contain information about all Service features. Use discoveryv1.EndpointSlice for complete information about Service endpoints.
 *
 * Deprecated: This API is deprecated in v1.33+. Use discoveryv1.EndpointSlice.
