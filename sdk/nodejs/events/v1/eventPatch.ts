 * Patch resources are used to modify existing Kubernetes resources by using
 * Server-Side Apply updates. The name of the resource must be specified, but all other properties are optional. More than
 * one patch may be applied to the same resource, and a random FieldManager name will be used for each Patch resource.
 * Conflicts will result in an error by default, but can be forced using the "pulumi.com/patchForce" annotation. See the
 * [Server-Side Apply Docs](https://www.pulumi.com/registry/packages/kubernetes/installation-configuration/#server-side-apply) for
 * additional information about using Server-Side Apply to manage Kubernetes resources with Pulumi.
 * Event is a report of an event somewhere in the cluster. It generally denotes some state change in the system. Events have a limited retention time and triggers and messages may evolve with time.  Event consumers should not rely on the timing of an event with a given Reason reflecting a consistent underlying trigger, or the continued existence of events with that Reason.  Events should be treated as informative, best-effort, supplemental data.
