    items is the list of horizontal pod autoscaler objects.
      * `api_version` (`str`) - APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources
      * `kind` (`str`) - Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
      * `metadata` (`dict`) - metadata is the standard object metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata
        * `annotations` (`dict`) - Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations
        * `cluster_name` (`str`) - The name of the cluster which the object belongs to. This is used to distinguish resources with same name and namespace in different clusters. This field is not set anywhere right now and apiserver is going to ignore it if set in create or update request.
        * `creation_timestamp` (`str`) - CreationTimestamp is a timestamp representing the server time when this object was created. It is not guaranteed to be set in happens-before order across separate operations. Clients may not set this value. It is represented in RFC3339 form and is in UTC.
          
          Populated by the system. Read-only. Null for lists. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata
        * `deletion_grace_period_seconds` (`float`) - Number of seconds allowed for this object to gracefully terminate before it will be removed from the system. Only set when deletionTimestamp is also set. May only be shortened. Read-only.
        * `deletion_timestamp` (`str`) - DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked. Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time. For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds, the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup, remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the resource is fully terminated. If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.
          
          Populated by the system when a graceful deletion is requested. Read-only. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata
        * `finalizers` (`list`) - Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.
        * `generate_name` (`str`) - GenerateName is an optional prefix, used by the server, to generate a unique name ONLY IF the Name field has not been provided. If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different than the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix. The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value unique on the server.
          
          If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will NOT return a 409 - instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason ServerTimeout indicating a unique name could not be found in the time allotted, and the client should retry (optionally after the time indicated in the Retry-After header).
          
          Applied only if Name is not specified. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#idempotency
        * `generation` (`float`) - A sequence number representing a specific generation of the desired state. Populated by the system. Read-only.
        * `labels` (`dict`) - Map of string keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize (scope and select) objects. May match selectors of replication controllers and services. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/labels
        * `managed_fields` (`list`) - ManagedFields maps workflow-id and version to the set of fields that are managed by that workflow. This is mostly for internal housekeeping, and users typically shouldn't need to set or understand this field. A workflow can be the user's name, a controller's name, or the name of a specific apply path like "ci-cd". The set of fields is always in the version that the workflow used when modifying the object.
          * `api_version` (`str`) - APIVersion defines the version of this resource that this field set applies to. The format is "group/version" just like the top-level APIVersion field. It is necessary to track the version of a field set because it cannot be automatically converted.
          * `fieldsType` (`str`) - FieldsType is the discriminator for the different fields format and version. There is currently only one possible value: "FieldsV1"
          * `fieldsV1` (`dict`) - FieldsV1 holds the first JSON version format as described in the "FieldsV1" type.
          * `manager` (`str`) - Manager is an identifier of the workflow managing these fields.
          * `operation` (`str`) - Operation is the type of operation which lead to this ManagedFieldsEntry being created. The only valid values for this field are 'Apply' and 'Update'.
          * `time` (`str`) - Time is timestamp of when these fields were set. It should always be empty if Operation is 'Apply'

        * `name` (`str`) - Name must be unique within a namespace. Is required when creating resources, although some resources may allow a client to request the generation of an appropriate name automatically. Name is primarily intended for creation idempotence and configuration definition. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#names
        * `namespace` (`str`) - Namespace defines the space within each name must be unique. An empty namespace is equivalent to the "default" namespace, but "default" is the canonical representation. Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the value of this field for those objects will be empty.
          
          Must be a DNS_LABEL. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/namespaces
        * `owner_references` (`list`) - List of objects depended by this object. If ALL objects in the list have been deleted, this object will be garbage collected. If this object is managed by a controller, then an entry in this list will point to this controller, with the controller field set to true. There cannot be more than one managing controller.
          * `api_version` (`str`) - API version of the referent.
          * `blockOwnerDeletion` (`bool`) - If true, AND if the owner has the "foregroundDeletion" finalizer, then the owner cannot be deleted from the key-value store until this reference is removed. Defaults to false. To set this field, a user needs "delete" permission of the owner, otherwise 422 (Unprocessable Entity) will be returned.
          * `controller` (`bool`) - If true, this reference points to the managing controller.
          * `kind` (`str`) - Kind of the referent. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
          * `name` (`str`) - Name of the referent. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#names
          * `uid` (`str`) - UID of the referent. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#uids

        * `resource_version` (`str`) - An opaque value that represents the internal version of this object that can be used by clients to determine when objects have changed. May be used for optimistic concurrency, change detection, and the watch operation on a resource or set of resources. Clients must treat these values as opaque and passed unmodified back to the server. They may only be valid for a particular resource or set of resources.
          
          Populated by the system. Read-only. Value must be treated as opaque by clients and . More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#concurrency-control-and-consistency
        * `self_link` (`str`) - SelfLink is a URL representing this object. Populated by the system. Read-only.
          
          DEPRECATED Kubernetes will stop propagating this field in 1.20 release and the field is planned to be removed in 1.21 release.
        * `uid` (`str`) - UID is the unique in time and space value for this object. It is typically generated by the server on successful creation of a resource and is not allowed to change on PUT operations.
          
          Populated by the system. Read-only. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#uids

      * `spec` (`dict`) - spec is the specification for the behaviour of the autoscaler. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#spec-and-status.
        * `behavior` (`dict`) - behavior configures the scaling behavior of the target in both Up and Down directions (scaleUp and scaleDown fields respectively). If not set, the default HPAScalingRules for scale up and scale down are used.
          * `scale_down` (`dict`) - scaleDown is scaling policy for scaling Down. If not set, the default value is to allow to scale down to minReplicas pods, with a 300 second stabilization window (i.e., the highest recommendation for the last 300sec is used).
            * `policies` (`list`) - policies is a list of potential scaling polices which can be used during scaling. At least one policy must be specified, otherwise the HPAScalingRules will be discarded as invalid
              * `periodSeconds` (`float`) - PeriodSeconds specifies the window of time for which the policy should hold true. PeriodSeconds must be greater than zero and less than or equal to 1800 (30 min).

            * `stabilization_window_seconds` (`float`) - StabilizationWindowSeconds is the number of seconds for which past recommendations should be considered while scaling up or scaling down. StabilizationWindowSeconds must be greater than or equal to zero and less than or equal to 3600 (one hour). If not set, use the default values: - For scale up: 0 (i.e. no stabilization is done). - For scale down: 300 (i.e. the stabilization window is 300 seconds long).

          * `scale_up` (`dict`) - scaleUp is scaling policy for scaling Up. If not set, the default value is the higher of:
              * increase no more than 4 pods per 60 seconds
              * double the number of pods per 60 seconds
            No stabilization is used.

        * `max_replicas` (`float`) - maxReplicas is the upper limit for the number of replicas to which the autoscaler can scale up. It cannot be less that minReplicas.
        * `metrics` (`list`) - metrics contains the specifications for which to use to calculate the desired replica count (the maximum replica count across all metrics will be used).  The desired replica count is calculated multiplying the ratio between the target value and the current value by the current number of pods.  Ergo, metrics used must decrease as the pod count is increased, and vice-versa.  See the individual metric source types for more information about how each type of metric must respond. If not set, the default metric will be set to 80% average CPU utilization.
          * `external` (`dict`) - external refers to a global metric that is not associated with any Kubernetes object.

              * `selector` (`dict`) - selector is the string-encoded form of a standard kubernetes label selector for the given metric When set, it is passed as an additional parameter to the metrics server for more specific metrics scoping. When unset, just the metricName will be used to gather metrics.
                * `match_expressions` (`list`) - matchExpressions is a list of label selector requirements. The requirements are ANDed.
                  * `key` (`str`) - key is the label key that the selector applies to.
                  * `operator` (`str`) - operator represents a key's relationship to a set of values. Valid operators are In, NotIn, Exists and DoesNotExist.
                  * `values` (`list`) - values is an array of string values. If the operator is In or NotIn, the values array must be non-empty. If the operator is Exists or DoesNotExist, the values array must be empty. This array is replaced during a strategic merge patch.

                * `match_labels` (`dict`) - matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is "key", the operator is "In", and the values array contains only "value". The requirements are ANDed.

            * `target` (`dict`) - target specifies the target value for the given metric
              * `averageUtilization` (`float`) - averageUtilization is the target value of the average of the resource metric across all relevant pods, represented as a percentage of the requested value of the resource for the pods. Currently only valid for Resource metric source type

It defaults to 1 pod.  minReplicas is allowed to be 0 if the alpha feature gate HPAScaleToZero is enabled and at least one Object or External metric is configured.  Scaling is active as long as at least one metric value is available.
        * `scale_target_ref` (`dict`) - scaleTargetRef points to the target resource to scale, and is used to the pods for which metrics should be collected, as well as to actually change the replica count.

            * `deletion_grace_period_seconds` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - Number of seconds allowed for this object to gracefully terminate before it will be removed from the system. Only set when deletionTimestamp is also set. May only be shortened. Read-only.
            * `deletion_timestamp` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked. Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time. For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds, the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup, remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the resource is fully terminated. If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.
              
              Populated by the system when a graceful deletion is requested. Read-only. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata
            * `finalizers` (`pulumi.Input[list]`) - Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.
            * `generate_name` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - GenerateName is an optional prefix, used by the server, to generate a unique name ONLY IF the Name field has not been provided. If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different than the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix. The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value unique on the server.
              
              If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will NOT return a 409 - instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason ServerTimeout indicating a unique name could not be found in the time allotted, and the client should retry (optionally after the time indicated in the Retry-After header).
              
              Applied only if Name is not specified. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#idempotency
            * `generation` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - A sequence number representing a specific generation of the desired state. Populated by the system. Read-only.
            * `labels` (`pulumi.Input[dict]`) - Map of string keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize (scope and select) objects. May match selectors of replication controllers and services. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/labels
            * `managed_fields` (`pulumi.Input[list]`) - ManagedFields maps workflow-id and version to the set of fields that are managed by that workflow. This is mostly for internal housekeeping, and users typically shouldn't need to set or understand this field. A workflow can be the user's name, a controller's name, or the name of a specific apply path like "ci-cd". The set of fields is always in the version that the workflow used when modifying the object.
              * `api_version` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - APIVersion defines the version of this resource that this field set applies to. The format is "group/version" just like the top-level APIVersion field. It is necessary to track the version of a field set because it cannot be automatically converted.
              * `fieldsType` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - FieldsType is the discriminator for the different fields format and version. There is currently only one possible value: "FieldsV1"
              * `fieldsV1` (`pulumi.Input[dict]`) - FieldsV1 holds the first JSON version format as described in the "FieldsV1" type.
              * `manager` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Manager is an identifier of the workflow managing these fields.
              * `operation` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Operation is the type of operation which lead to this ManagedFieldsEntry being created. The only valid values for this field are 'Apply' and 'Update'.
              * `time` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Time is timestamp of when these fields were set. It should always be empty if Operation is 'Apply'

            * `name` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Name must be unique within a namespace. Is required when creating resources, although some resources may allow a client to request the generation of an appropriate name automatically. Name is primarily intended for creation idempotence and configuration definition. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#names
            * `namespace` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Namespace defines the space within each name must be unique. An empty namespace is equivalent to the "default" namespace, but "default" is the canonical representation. Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the value of this field for those objects will be empty.
              
              Must be a DNS_LABEL. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/namespaces
            * `owner_references` (`pulumi.Input[list]`) - List of objects depended by this object. If ALL objects in the list have been deleted, this object will be garbage collected. If this object is managed by a controller, then an entry in this list will point to this controller, with the controller field set to true. There cannot be more than one managing controller.
              * `api_version` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - API version of the referent.
              * `blockOwnerDeletion` (`pulumi.Input[bool]`) - If true, AND if the owner has the "foregroundDeletion" finalizer, then the owner cannot be deleted from the key-value store until this reference is removed. Defaults to false. To set this field, a user needs "delete" permission of the owner, otherwise 422 (Unprocessable Entity) will be returned.
              * `controller` (`pulumi.Input[bool]`) - If true, this reference points to the managing controller.
              * `kind` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Kind of the referent. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

              * `uid` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - UID of the referent. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#uids

            * `resource_version` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - An opaque value that represents the internal version of this object that can be used by clients to determine when objects have changed. May be used for optimistic concurrency, change detection, and the watch operation on a resource or set of resources. Clients must treat these values as opaque and passed unmodified back to the server. They may only be valid for a particular resource or set of resources.
              
              Populated by the system. Read-only. Value must be treated as opaque by clients and . More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#concurrency-control-and-consistency
            * `self_link` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - SelfLink is a URL representing this object. Populated by the system. Read-only.
              
              DEPRECATED Kubernetes will stop propagating this field in 1.20 release and the field is planned to be removed in 1.21 release.
            * `uid` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - UID is the unique in time and space value for this object. It is typically generated by the server on successful creation of a resource and is not allowed to change on PUT operations.
              
              Populated by the system. Read-only. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#uids

          * `spec` (`pulumi.Input[dict]`) - spec is the specification for the behaviour of the autoscaler. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#spec-and-status.
            * `behavior` (`pulumi.Input[dict]`) - behavior configures the scaling behavior of the target in both Up and Down directions (scaleUp and scaleDown fields respectively). If not set, the default HPAScalingRules for scale up and scale down are used.

                * `stabilization_window_seconds` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - StabilizationWindowSeconds is the number of seconds for which past recommendations should be considered while scaling up or scaling down. StabilizationWindowSeconds must be greater than or equal to zero and less than or equal to 3600 (one hour). If not set, use the default values: - For scale up: 0 (i.e. no stabilization is done). - For scale down: 300 (i.e. the stabilization window is 300 seconds long).

              * `scale_up` (`pulumi.Input[dict]`) - scaleUp is scaling policy for scaling Up. If not set, the default value is the higher of:
                  * increase no more than 4 pods per 60 seconds

Ergo, metrics used must decrease as the pod count is increased, and vice-versa.  See the individual metric source types for more information about how each type of metric must respond. If not set, the default metric will be set to 80% average CPU utilization.
              * `external` (`pulumi.Input[dict]`) - external refers to a global metric that is not associated with any Kubernetes object. It allows autoscaling based on information coming from components running outside of cluster (for example length of queue in cloud messaging service, or QPS from loadbalancer running outside of cluster).

                  * `name` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - name is the name of the given metric
                  * `selector` (`pulumi.Input[dict]`) - selector is the string-encoded form of a standard kubernetes label selector for the given metric When set, it is passed as an additional parameter to the metrics server for more specific metrics scoping. When unset, just the metricName will be used to gather metrics.
                    * `match_expressions` (`pulumi.Input[list]`) - matchExpressions is a list of label selector requirements. The requirements are ANDed.
                      * `key` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - key is the label key that the selector applies to.
                      * `operator` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - operator represents a key's relationship to a set of values. Valid operators are In, NotIn, Exists and DoesNotExist.
                      * `values` (`pulumi.Input[list]`) - values is an array of string values. If the operator is In or NotIn, the values array must be non-empty. If the operator is Exists or DoesNotExist, the values array must be empty. This array is replaced during a strategic merge patch.

                    * `match_labels` (`pulumi.Input[dict]`) - matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is "key", the operator is "In", and the values array contains only "value". The requirements are ANDed.

        The **metadata** object supports the following:

          * `continue_` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - continue may be set if the user set a limit on the number of items returned, and indicates that the server has more data available. The value is opaque and may be used to issue another request to the endpoint that served this list to retrieve the next set of available objects. Continuing a consistent list may not be possible if the server configuration has changed or more than a few minutes have passed. The resourceVersion field returned when using this continue value will be identical to the value in the first response, unless you have received this token from an error message.
          * `remaining_item_count` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - remainingItemCount is the number of subsequent items in the list which are not included in this list response. If the list request contained label or field selectors, then the number of remaining items is unknown and the field will be left unset and omitted during serialization. If the list is complete (either because it is not chunking or because this is the last chunk), then there are no more remaining items and this field will be left unset and omitted during serialization. Servers older than v1.15 do not set this field. The intended use of the remainingItemCount is *estimating* the size of a collection. Clients should not rely on the remainingItemCount to be set or to be exact.
          * `resource_version` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - String that identifies the server's internal version of this object that can be used by clients to determine when objects have changed. Value must be treated as opaque by clients and passed unmodified back to the server. Populated by the system. Read-only.
