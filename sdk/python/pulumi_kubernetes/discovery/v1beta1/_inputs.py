These key/value pairs must conform with the label format. https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels Topology may include a maximum of 16 key/value pairs. This includes, but is not limited to the following well known keys: * kubernetes.io/hostname: the value indicates the hostname of the node
          where the endpoint is located. This should match the corresponding
          node label.
        * topology.kubernetes.io/zone: the value indicates the zone where the
          endpoint is located. This should match the corresponding node label.
        * topology.kubernetes.io/region: the value indicates the region where the
          endpoint is located. This should match the corresponding node label.
