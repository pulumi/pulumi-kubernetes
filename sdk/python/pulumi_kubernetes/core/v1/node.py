    Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata
      * `annotations` (`dict`) - Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations
      * `cluster_name` (`str`) - The name of the cluster which the object belongs to. This is used to distinguish resources with same name and namespace in different clusters. This field is not set anywhere right now and apiserver is going to ignore it if set in create or update request.
      * `creation_timestamp` (`str`) - CreationTimestamp is a timestamp representing the server time when this object was created. It is not guaranteed to be set in happens-before order across separate operations. Clients may not set this value. It is represented in RFC3339 form and is in UTC.
        
        Populated by the system. Read-only. Null for lists. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata
      * `deletion_grace_period_seconds` (`float`) - Number of seconds allowed for this object to gracefully terminate before it will be removed from the system. Only set when deletionTimestamp is also set. May only be shortened. Read-only.
      * `deletion_timestamp` (`str`) - DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked. Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time. For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds, the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup, remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the resource is fully terminated. If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.
        
        Populated by the system when a graceful deletion is requested. Read-only. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata
      * `finalizers` (`list`) - Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.
      * `generate_name` (`str`) - GenerateName is an optional prefix, used by the server, to generate a unique name ONLY IF the Name field has not been provided. If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different than the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix. The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value unique on the server.
        
        If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will NOT return a 409 - instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason ServerTimeout indicating a unique name could not be found in the time allotted, and the client should retry (optionally after the time indicated in the Retry-After header).
        
        Applied only if Name is not specified. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#idempotency
      * `generation` (`float`) - A sequence number representing a specific generation of the desired state. Populated by the system. Read-only.
      * `labels` (`dict`) - Map of string keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize (scope and select) objects. May match selectors of replication controllers and services. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/labels
      * `managed_fields` (`list`) - ManagedFields maps workflow-id and version to the set of fields that are managed by that workflow. This is mostly for internal housekeeping, and users typically shouldn't need to set or understand this field. A workflow can be the user's name, a controller's name, or the name of a specific apply path like "ci-cd". The set of fields is always in the version that the workflow used when modifying the object.
        * `api_version` (`str`) - APIVersion defines the version of this resource that this field set applies to. The format is "group/version" just like the top-level APIVersion field. It is necessary to track the version of a field set because it cannot be automatically converted.
        * `fieldsType` (`str`) - FieldsType is the discriminator for the different fields format and version. There is currently only one possible value: "FieldsV1"
        * `fieldsV1` (`dict`) - FieldsV1 holds the first JSON version format as described in the "FieldsV1" type.
        * `manager` (`str`) - Manager is an identifier of the workflow managing these fields.
        * `operation` (`str`) - Operation is the type of operation which lead to this ManagedFieldsEntry being created. The only valid values for this field are 'Apply' and 'Update'.
        * `time` (`str`) - Time is timestamp of when these fields were set. It should always be empty if Operation is 'Apply'

      * `name` (`str`) - Name must be unique within a namespace. Is required when creating resources, although some resources may allow a client to request the generation of an appropriate name automatically. Name is primarily intended for creation idempotence and configuration definition. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#names
      * `namespace` (`str`) - Namespace defines the space within each name must be unique. An empty namespace is equivalent to the "default" namespace, but "default" is the canonical representation. Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the value of this field for those objects will be empty.
        
        Must be a DNS_LABEL. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/namespaces
      * `owner_references` (`list`) - List of objects depended by this object. If ALL objects in the list have been deleted, this object will be garbage collected. If this object is managed by a controller, then an entry in this list will point to this controller, with the controller field set to true. There cannot be more than one managing controller.
        * `api_version` (`str`) - API version of the referent.
        * `blockOwnerDeletion` (`bool`) - If true, AND if the owner has the "foregroundDeletion" finalizer, then the owner cannot be deleted from the key-value store until this reference is removed. Defaults to false. To set this field, a user needs "delete" permission of the owner, otherwise 422 (Unprocessable Entity) will be returned.
        * `controller` (`bool`) - If true, this reference points to the managing controller.
        * `kind` (`str`) - Kind of the referent. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
        * `name` (`str`) - Name of the referent. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#names
        * `uid` (`str`) - UID of the referent. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#uids

      * `resource_version` (`str`) - An opaque value that represents the internal version of this object that can be used by clients to determine when objects have changed. May be used for optimistic concurrency, change detection, and the watch operation on a resource or set of resources. Clients must treat these values as opaque and passed unmodified back to the server. They may only be valid for a particular resource or set of resources.
        
        Populated by the system. Read-only. Value must be treated as opaque by clients and . More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#concurrency-control-and-consistency
      * `self_link` (`str`) - SelfLink is a URL representing this object. Populated by the system. Read-only.
        
        DEPRECATED Kubernetes will stop propagating this field in 1.20 release and the field is planned to be removed in 1.21 release.
      * `uid` (`str`) - UID is the unique in time and space value for this object. It is typically generated by the server on successful creation of a resource and is not allowed to change on PUT operations.

    Spec defines the behavior of a node. https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#spec-and-status
      * `config_source` (`dict`) - If specified, the source to get node configuration from The DynamicKubeletConfig feature gate must be enabled for the Kubelet to use this field

More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/nodes/node/#addresses Note: This field is declared as mergeable, but the merge key is not sufficiently unique, which can cause data corruption when it is merged. Callers should instead use a full-replacement patch. See http://pr.k8s.io/79391 for an example.
        * `address` (`str`) - The node address.
        * `type` (`str`) - Node address type, one of Hostname, ExternalIP or InternalIP.

      * `allocatable` (`dict`) - Allocatable represents the resources of a node that are available for scheduling. Defaults to Capacity.

        * `status` (`str`) - Status of the condition, one of True, False, Unknown.
        * `type` (`str`) - Type of node condition.

      * `config` (`dict`) - Status of the config assigned to the node via the dynamic Kubelet config feature.
        * `active` (`dict`) - Active reports the checkpointed config the node is actively using. Active will represent either the current version of the Assigned config, or the current LastKnownGood config, depending on whether attempting to use the Assigned config results in an error.
          * `config_map` (`dict`) - ConfigMap is a reference to a Node's ConfigMap
            * `kubelet_config_key` (`str`) - KubeletConfigKey declares which key of the referenced ConfigMap corresponds to the KubeletConfiguration structure This field is required in all cases.

            * `uid` (`str`) - UID is the metadata.UID of the referenced ConfigMap. This field is forbidden in Node.Spec, and required in Node.Status.

        * `assigned` (`dict`) - Assigned reports the checkpointed config the node will try to use. When Node.Spec.ConfigSource is updated, the node checkpoints the associated config payload to local disk, along with a record indicating intended config. The node refers to this record to choose its config checkpoint, and reports this record in Assigned. Assigned only updates in the status after the record has been checkpointed to disk. When the Kubelet is restarted, it tries to make the Assigned config the Active config by loading and validating the checkpointed payload identified by Assigned.
        * `error` (`str`) - Error describes any problems reconciling the Spec.ConfigSource to the Active config. Errors may occur, for example, attempting to checkpoint Spec.ConfigSource to the local Assigned record, attempting to checkpoint the payload associated with Spec.ConfigSource, attempting to load or validate the Assigned config, etc. Errors may occur at different points while syncing config. Earlier errors (e.g. download or checkpointing errors) will not result in a rollback to LastKnownGood, and may resolve across Kubelet retries. Later errors (e.g. loading or validating a checkpointed config) will result in a rollback to LastKnownGood. In the latter case, it is usually possible to resolve the error by fixing the config assigned in Spec.ConfigSource. You can find additional information for debugging by searching the error message in the Kubelet log. Error is a human-readable description of the error state; machines can check whether or not Error is empty, but should not rely on the stability of the Error text across Kubelet versions.
        * `last_known_good` (`dict`) - LastKnownGood reports the checkpointed config the node will fall back to when it encounters an error attempting to use the Assigned config. The Assigned config becomes the LastKnownGood config when the node determines that the Assigned config is stable and correct. This is currently implemented as a 10-minute soak period starting when the local record of Assigned config is updated. If the Assigned config is Active at the end of this period, it becomes the LastKnownGood. Note that if Spec.ConfigSource is reset to nil (use local defaults), the LastKnownGood is also immediately reset to nil, because the local default config is always assumed good. You should not make assumptions about the node's method of determining config stability and correctness, as this may change or become configurable in the future.

      * `daemon_endpoints` (`dict`) - Endpoints of daemons running on the Node.
        * `kubelet_endpoint` (`dict`) - Endpoint on which Kubelet is listening.

            * `api_version` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - API version of the referent.
            * `blockOwnerDeletion` (`pulumi.Input[bool]`) - If true, AND if the owner has the "foregroundDeletion" finalizer, then the owner cannot be deleted from the key-value store until this reference is removed. Defaults to false. To set this field, a user needs "delete" permission of the owner, otherwise 422 (Unprocessable Entity) will be returned.
            * `controller` (`pulumi.Input[bool]`) - If true, this reference points to the managing controller.
            * `kind` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Kind of the referent. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

            * `uid` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - UID of the referent. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#uids

          * `resource_version` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - An opaque value that represents the internal version of this object that can be used by clients to determine when objects have changed. May be used for optimistic concurrency, change detection, and the watch operation on a resource or set of resources. Clients must treat these values as opaque and passed unmodified back to the server. They may only be valid for a particular resource or set of resources.
            
            Populated by the system. Read-only. Value must be treated as opaque by clients and . More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#concurrency-control-and-consistency
          * `self_link` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - SelfLink is a URL representing this object. Populated by the system. Read-only.
            
            DEPRECATED Kubernetes will stop propagating this field in 1.20 release and the field is planned to be removed in 1.21 release.
          * `uid` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - UID is the unique in time and space value for this object. It is typically generated by the server on successful creation of a resource and is not allowed to change on PUT operations.
            
            Populated by the system. Read-only. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#uids

        The **spec** object supports the following:

          * `config_source` (`pulumi.Input[dict]`) - If specified, the source to get node configuration from The DynamicKubeletConfig feature gate must be enabled for the Kubelet to use this field
            * `config_map` (`pulumi.Input[dict]`) - ConfigMap is a reference to a Node's ConfigMap
              * `kubelet_config_key` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - KubeletConfigKey declares which key of the referenced ConfigMap corresponds to the KubeletConfiguration structure This field is required in all cases.
              * `name` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Name is the metadata.name of the referenced ConfigMap. This field is required in all cases.
              * `namespace` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Namespace is the metadata.namespace of the referenced ConfigMap. This field is required in all cases.
              * `resource_version` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - ResourceVersion is the metadata.ResourceVersion of the referenced ConfigMap. This field is forbidden in Node.Spec, and required in Node.Status.
              * `uid` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - UID is the metadata.UID of the referenced ConfigMap. This field is forbidden in Node.Spec, and required in Node.Status.

          * `external_id` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Deprecated. Not all kubelets will set this field. Remove field after 1.13. see: https://issues.k8s.io/61966
