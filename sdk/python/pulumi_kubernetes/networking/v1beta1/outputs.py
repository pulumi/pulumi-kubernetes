        Ingress is a collection of rules that allow inbound connections to reach the endpoints defined by a backend. An Ingress can be configured to give services externally-reachable urls, load balance traffic, terminate SSL, offer name based virtual hosting etc.

        This resource waits until its status is ready before registering success
        for create/update, and populating output properties from the current state of the resource.
        The following conditions are used to determine whether the resource creation has
        succeeded or failed:

        1.  Ingress object exists.
        2.  Endpoint objects exist with matching names for each Ingress path (except when Service
            type is ExternalName).
        3.  Ingress entry exists for '.status.loadBalancer.ingress'.

        If the Ingress has not reached a Ready state after 10 minutes, it will
        time out and mark the resource update as Failed. You can override the default timeout value
        by setting the 'customTimeouts' option on the resource.
