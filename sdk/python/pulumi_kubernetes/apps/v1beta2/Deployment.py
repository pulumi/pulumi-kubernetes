        Deployment enables declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets.

        This resource waits until its status is ready before registering success
        for create/update, and populating output properties from the current state of the resource.
        The following conditions are used to determine whether the resource creation has
        succeeded or failed:

        1. The Deployment has begun to be updated by the Deployment controller. If the current
           generation of the Deployment is > 1, then this means that the current generation must
           be different from the generation reported by the last outputs.
        2. There exists a ReplicaSet whose revision is equal to the current revision of the
           Deployment.
        3. The Deployment's '.status.conditions' has a status of type 'Available' whose 'status'
           member is set to 'True'.
        4. If the Deployment has generation > 1, then '.status.conditions' has a status of type
           'Progressing', whose 'status' member is set to 'True', and whose 'reason' is
           'NewReplicaSetAvailable'. For generation <= 1, this status field does not exist,
           because it doesn't do a rollout (i.e., it simply creates the Deployment and
           corresponding ReplicaSet), and therefore there is no rollout to mark as 'Progressing'.

        If the Deployment has not reached a Ready state after 10 minutes, it will
        time out and mark the resource update as Failed. You can override the default timeout value
        by setting the 'customTimeouts' option on the resource.
