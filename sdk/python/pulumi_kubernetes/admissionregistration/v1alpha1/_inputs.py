The value is null for CREATE requests. - 'request' - Attributes of the API request([ref](/pkg/apis/admission/types.go#AdmissionRequest)). - 'params' - Parameter resource referred to by the policy binding being evaluated. Only populated if the policy has a ParamKind. - 'namespaceObject' - The namespace object that the incoming object belongs to. The value is null for cluster-scoped resources. - 'variables' - Map of composited variables, from its name to its lazily evaluated value.
          For example, a variable named 'foo' can be accessed as 'variables.foo'.
        - 'authorizer' - A CEL Authorizer. May be used to perform authorization checks for the principal (user or service account) of the request.

          function may be used to escape path keys containing '/' and '~'.
        - 'Object' - CEL type of the resource object. - 'Object.<fieldName>' - CEL type of object field (such as 'Object.spec') - 'Object.<fieldName1>.<fieldName2>...<fieldNameN>` - CEL type of nested field (such as 'Object.spec.containers')

        CEL expressions have access to the contents of the API request, organized into CEL variables as well as some other useful variables:

        - 'object' - The object from the incoming request. The value is null for DELETE requests. - 'oldObject' - The existing object. The value is null for CREATE requests. - 'request' - Attributes of the API request([ref](/pkg/apis/admission/types.go#AdmissionRequest)). - 'params' - Parameter resource referred to by the policy binding being evaluated. Only populated if the policy has a ParamKind. - 'namespaceObject' - The namespace object that the incoming object belongs to. The value is null for cluster-scoped resources. - 'variables' - Map of composited variables, from its name to its lazily evaluated value.
          For example, a variable named 'foo' can be accessed as 'variables.foo'.
        - 'authorizer' - A CEL Authorizer. May be used to perform authorization checks for the principal (user or service account) of the request.
          See https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/cel/library#Authz
        - 'authorizer.requestResource' - A CEL ResourceCheck constructed from the 'authorizer' and configured with the
          request resource.

        	  ]

        To define an object for the patch value, use Object types. For example:

        	  [
        	    JSONPatch{
        	      op: "add",
        	      path: "/spec/selector",
        	      value: Object.spec.selector{matchLabels: {"environment": "test"}}
        	    }
        	  ]

        To use strings containing '/' and '~' as JSONPatch path keys, use "jsonpatch.escapeKey". For example:

        	  [
        	    JSONPatch{
        	      op: "add",
        	      path: "/metadata/labels/" + jsonpatch.escapeKey("example.com/environment"),
        	      value: "test"
        	    },
        	  ]

        CEL expressions have access to the types needed to create JSON patches and objects:

        - 'JSONPatch' - CEL type of JSON Patch operations. JSONPatch has the fields 'op', 'from', 'path' and 'value'.
          See [JSON patch](https://jsonpatch.com/) for more details. The 'value' field may be set to any of: string,
          integer, array, map or object.  If set, the 'path' and 'from' fields must be set to a
          [JSON pointer](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6901/) string, where the 'jsonpatch.escapeKey()' CEL
          function may be used to escape path keys containing '/' and '~'.
        - 'Object' - CEL type of the resource object. - 'Object.<fieldName>' - CEL type of object field (such as 'Object.spec') - 'Object.<fieldName1>.<fieldName2>...<fieldNameN>` - CEL type of nested field (such as 'Object.spec.containers')

        CEL expressions have access to the contents of the API request, organized into CEL variables as well as some other useful variables:

        - 'object' - The object from the incoming request. The value is null for DELETE requests. - 'oldObject' - The existing object. The value is null for CREATE requests. - 'request' - Attributes of the API request([ref](/pkg/apis/admission/types.go#AdmissionRequest)). - 'params' - Parameter resource referred to by the policy binding being evaluated. Only populated if the policy has a ParamKind. - 'namespaceObject' - The namespace object that the incoming object belongs to. The value is null for cluster-scoped resources. - 'variables' - Map of composited variables, from its name to its lazily evaluated value.
          For example, a variable named 'foo' can be accessed as 'variables.foo'.
        - 'authorizer' - A CEL Authorizer. May be used to perform authorization checks for the principal (user or service account) of the request.
          See https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/cel/library#Authz
        - 'authorizer.requestResource' - A CEL ResourceCheck constructed from the 'authorizer' and configured with the
          request resource.

        CEL expressions have access to [Kubernetes CEL function libraries](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/cel/#cel-options-language-features-and-libraries) as well as:

        - 'jsonpatch.escapeKey' - Performs JSONPatch key escaping. '~' and  '/' are escaped as '~0' and `~1' respectively).

                   }

               }
               
               If instead you want to only run the policy on any objects whose namespace is associated with the "environment" of "prod" or "staging"; you will set the selector as follows: "namespaceSelector": {
                 "matchExpressions": [

        For a given admission request, each binding will cause its policy to be evaluated N times, where N is 1 for policies/bindings that don't use params, otherwise N is the number of parameters selected by the binding. Each evaluation is constrained by a [runtime cost budget](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/cel/#runtime-cost-budget).

        Adding/removing policies, bindings, or params can not affect whether a given (policy, binding, param) combination is within its own CEL budget.
