The possible values are specific to the node &amp; CRI configuration.  It is assumed that all handlers are available on every node, and handlers of the same name are equivalent on every node. For example, a handler called "runc" might specify that the runc OCI runtime (using native Linux containers) will be used to run the containers in a pod. The RuntimeHandler must be lowercase, conform to the DNS Label (RFC 1123) requirements, and is immutable.
