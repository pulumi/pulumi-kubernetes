The value is null for CREATE requests. - 'request' - Attributes of the API request([ref](/pkg/apis/admission/types.go#AdmissionRequest)). - 'params' - Parameter resource referred to by the policy binding being evaluated. Only populated if the policy has a ParamKind. - 'namespaceObject' - The namespace object that the incoming object belongs to. The value is null for cluster-scoped resources. - 'variables' - Map of composited variables, from its name to its lazily evaluated value.
        ///   For example, a variable named 'foo' can be accessed as 'variables.foo'.
        /// - 'authorizer' - A CEL Authorizer. May be used to perform authorization checks for the principal (user or service account) of the request.
        ///   See https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/cel/library#Authz
        /// - 'authorizer.requestResource' - A CEL ResourceCheck constructed from the 'authorizer' and configured with the
        ///   request resource.
        /// 
        /// The `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata.name` and `metadata.generateName` are always accessible from the root of the object. No other metadata properties are accessible.
