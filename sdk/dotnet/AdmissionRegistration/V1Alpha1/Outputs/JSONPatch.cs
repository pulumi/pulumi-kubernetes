        /// expression must return an array of JSONPatch values.
        /// 
        /// For example, this CEL expression returns a JSON patch to conditionally modify a value:
        /// 
        /// 	  [
        /// 	    JSONPatch{op: "test", path: "/spec/example", value: "Red"},
        /// 	    JSONPatch{op: "replace", path: "/spec/example", value: "Green"}
        /// 	  ]
        /// 
        /// To define an object for the patch value, use Object types. For example:
        /// 
        /// 	  [
        /// 	    JSONPatch{
        /// 	      op: "add",

        /// 	    }
        /// 	  ]
        /// 
        /// To use strings containing '/' and '~' as JSONPatch path keys, use "jsonpatch.escapeKey". For example:

        /// 	  [
        /// 	    JSONPatch{

        ///   See [JSON patch](https://jsonpatch.com/) for more details. The 'value' field may be set to any of: string,
        ///   integer, array, map or object.  If set, the 'path' and 'from' fields must be set to a
        ///   [JSON pointer](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6901/) string, where the 'jsonpatch.escapeKey()' CEL
        ///   function may be used to escape path keys containing '/' and '~'.
        /// - 'Object' - CEL type of the resource object. - 'Object.&lt;fieldName&gt;' - CEL type of object field (such as 'Object.spec') - 'Object.&lt;fieldName1&gt;.&lt;fieldName2&gt;...&lt;fieldNameN&gt;` - CEL type of nested field (such as 'Object.spec.containers')
        /// 
        /// CEL expressions have access to the contents of the API request, organized into CEL variables as well as some other useful variables:
        /// 
        /// - 'object' - The object from the incoming request. The value is null for DELETE requests. - 'oldObject' - The existing object. The value is null for CREATE requests. - 'request' - Attributes of the API request([ref](/pkg/apis/admission/types.go#AdmissionRequest)). - 'params' - Parameter resource referred to by the policy binding being evaluated. Only populated if the policy has a ParamKind. - 'namespaceObject' - The namespace object that the incoming object belongs to. The value is null for cluster-scoped resources. - 'variables' - Map of composited variables, from its name to its lazily evaluated value.
        ///   For example, a variable named 'foo' can be accessed as 'variables.foo'.
        /// - 'authorizer' - A CEL Authorizer. May be used to perform authorization checks for the principal (user or service account) of the request.
        ///   See https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/cel/library#Authz
        /// - 'authorizer.requestResource' - A CEL ResourceCheck constructed from the 'authorizer' and configured with the
