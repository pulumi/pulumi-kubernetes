    ///  - Network: A single stable DNS and hostname.

    /// The StatefulSet guarantees that a given network identity will always map to the same storage identity.
    /// 
    /// This resource waits until its status is ready before registering success
    /// for create/update, and populating output properties from the current state of the resource.
    /// The following conditions are used to determine whether the resource creation has
    /// succeeded or failed:
    /// 
    /// 1. The value of 'spec.replicas' matches '.status.replicas', '.status.currentReplicas',
    ///    and '.status.readyReplicas'.
    /// 2. The value of '.status.updateRevision' matches '.status.currentRevision'.
    /// 
    /// If the StatefulSet has not reached a Ready state after 10 minutes, it will
    /// time out and mark the resource update as Failed. You can override the default timeout value
    /// by setting the 'customTimeouts' option on the resource.
