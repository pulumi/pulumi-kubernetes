    /// succeeded or failed:
    /// 
    /// 1. The Deployment has begun to be updated by the Deployment controller. If the current
    ///    generation of the Deployment is &amp;gt; 1, then this means that the current generation
    /// must
    ///    be different from the generation reported by the last outputs.
    /// 2. There exists a ReplicaSet whose revision is equal to the current revision of the
    ///    Deployment.
    /// 3. The Deployment's '.status.conditions' has a status of type 'Available' whose 'status'
    ///    member is set to 'True'.
    /// 4. If the Deployment has generation &amp;gt; 1, then '.status.conditions' has a status of
    /// type
    ///    'Progressing', whose 'status' member is set to 'True', and whose 'reason' is
    ///    'NewReplicaSetAvailable'. For generation &amp;lt;= 1, this status field does not exist,
    ///    because it doesn't do a rollout (i.e., it simply creates the Deployment and
    ///    corresponding ReplicaSet), and therefore there is no rollout to mark as 'Progressing'.
    /// 
    /// If the Deployment has not reached a Ready state after 10 minutes, it will
    /// time out and mark the resource update as Failed. You can override the default timeout value
    /// by setting the 'customTimeouts' option on the resource.
