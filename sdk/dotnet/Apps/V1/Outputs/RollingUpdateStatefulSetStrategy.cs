Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding up. This can not be 0. Defaults to 1. This field is beta-level and is enabled by default. The field applies to all pods in the range 0 to Replicas-1. That means if there is any unavailable pod in the range 0 to Replicas-1, it will be counted towards MaxUnavailable. This setting might not be effective for the OrderedReady podManagementPolicy. That policy ensures pods are created and become ready one at a time.
