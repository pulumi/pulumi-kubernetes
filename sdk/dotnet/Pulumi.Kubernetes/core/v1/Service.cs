    /// This resource waits until its status is ready before registering success
    /// for create/update, and populating output properties from the current state of the resource.
    /// The following conditions are used to determine whether the resource creation has
    /// succeeded or failed:
    /// 
    /// 1. Service object exists.
    /// 2. Related Endpoint objects are created. Each time we get an update, wait 10 seconds
    ///    for any stragglers.
    /// 3. The endpoints objects target some number of living objects (unless the Service is
    ///    an "empty headless" Service [1] or a Service with '.spec.type: ExternalName').
    /// 4. External IP address is allocated (if Service has '.spec.type: LoadBalancer').
    /// 
    /// Known limitations: 
    /// Services targeting ReplicaSets (and, by extension, Deployments,
    /// StatefulSets, etc.) with '.spec.replicas' set to 0 are not handled, and will time
    /// out. To work around this limitation, set 'pulumi.com/skipAwait: "true"' on
    /// '.metadata.annotations' for the Service. Work to handle this case is in progress [2].
