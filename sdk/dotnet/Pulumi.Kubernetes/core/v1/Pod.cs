/// <summary>
/// Pod is a collection of containers that can run on a host. This resource is created by clients
/// and scheduled onto hosts.
/// 
/// This resource waits until its status is ready before registering success
/// for create/update, and populating output properties from the current state of the resource.
/// The following conditions are used to determine whether the resource creation has
/// succeeded or failed:
/// 
/// 1. The Pod is scheduled ("PodScheduled"" '.status.condition' is true).
/// 2. The Pod is initialized ("Initialized" '.status.condition' is true).
/// 3. The Pod is ready ("Ready" '.status.condition' is true) and the '.status.phase' is
///    set to "Running".
/// Or (for Jobs): The Pod succeeded ('.status.phase' set to "Succeeded").
/// 
/// If the Pod has not reached a Ready state after 10 minutes, it will
/// time out and mark the resource update as Failed. You can override the default timeout value
/// by setting the 'customTimeouts' option on the resource.
