/// Job represents the configuration of a single job.
/// 
/// This resource waits until its status is ready before registering success
/// for create/update, and populating output properties from the current state of the resource.
/// The following conditions are used to determine whether the resource creation has
/// succeeded or failed:
/// 
/// 1. The Job's '.status.startTime' is set, which indicates that the Job has started running.
/// 2. The Job's '.status.conditions' has a status of type 'Complete', and a 'status' set
///    to 'True'.
/// 3. The Job's '.status.conditions' do not have a status of type 'Failed', with a
/// 	'status' set to 'True'. If this condition is set, we should fail the Job immediately.
/// 
/// If the Job has not reached a Ready state after 10 minutes, it will
/// time out and mark the resource update as Failed. You can override the default timeout value
/// by setting the 'customTimeouts' option on the resource.
