/// DEPRECATED - apps/v1beta2/StatefulSet is not supported by Kubernetes 1.16+ clusters. Use
/// apps/v1/StatefulSet instead.
/// 
/// StatefulSet represents a set of pods with consistent identities. Identities are defined as:
///  - Network: A single stable DNS and hostname.
///  - Storage: As many VolumeClaims as requested.
/// The StatefulSet guarantees that a given network identity will always map to the same storage
/// identity.
/// 
/// This resource waits until its status is ready before registering success
/// for create/update, and populating output properties from the current state of the resource.
/// The following conditions are used to determine whether the resource creation has
/// succeeded or failed:
/// 
/// 1. The value of 'spec.replicas' matches '.status.replicas', '.status.currentReplicas',
///    and '.status.readyReplicas'.
/// 2. The value of '.status.updateRevision' matches '.status.currentRevision'.
/// 
/// If the StatefulSet has not reached a Ready state after 10 minutes, it will
/// time out and mark the resource update as Failed. You can override the default timeout value
/// by setting the 'customTimeouts' option on the resource.
