    /// This resource waits until its status is ready before registering success
    /// for create/update, and populating output properties from the current state of the resource.
    /// The following conditions are used to determine whether the resource creation has
    /// succeeded or failed:
    /// 
    /// 1. Service object exists.
    /// 2. Related Endpoint objects are created. Each time we get an update, wait 10 seconds
    ///    for any stragglers.
    /// 3. There are no "not ready" endpoints -- unless the Service is an "empty
    ///    headless" Service [1], a Service with '.spec.type: ExternalName', or a Service
    ///    without a selector.
    /// 4. External IP address is allocated (if Service has '.spec.type: LoadBalancer').
    /// 
    /// If the Service has not reached a Ready state after 10 minutes, it will
    /// time out and mark the resource update as Failed. You can override the default timeout value
    /// by setting the 'customTimeouts' option on the resource.
