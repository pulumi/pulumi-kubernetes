In a dual-stack cluster, you can specify ipFamily when creating a ClusterIP Service to determine whether the controller will allocate an IPv4 or IPv6 IP for it, and you can specify ipFamily when creating a headless Service to determine whether it will have IPv4 or IPv6 Endpoints. In either case, if you do not specify an ipFamily explicitly, it will default to the cluster's primary IP family. This field is part of an alpha feature, and you should not make any assumptions about its semantics other than those described above. In particular, you should not assume that it can (or cannot) be changed after creation time; that it can only have the values "IPv4" and "IPv6"; or that its current value on a given Service correctly reflects the current state of that Service. (For ClusterIP Services, look at clusterIP to see if the Service is IPv4 or IPv6. For headless Services, look at the endpoints, which may be dual-stack in the future. For ExternalName Services, ipFamily has no meaning, but it may be set to an irrelevant value anyway.)

The primary use case for setting this field is for a StatefulSet's Headless Service to propagate SRV DNS records for its Pods for the purpose of peer discovery. The Kubernetes controllers that generate Endpoints and EndpointSlice resources for Services interpret this to mean that all endpoints are considered "ready" even if the Pods themselves are not. Agents which consume only Kubernetes generated endpoints through the Endpoints or EndpointSlice resources can safely assume this behavior.

"ExternalName" maps to the specified externalName. "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather than a stable IP. "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which routes to the clusterIP. "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the clusterIP.
