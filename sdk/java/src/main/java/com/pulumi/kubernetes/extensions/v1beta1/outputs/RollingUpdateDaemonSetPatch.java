Example: when this is set to 30%, at most 30% of the total number of nodes that should be running the daemon pod (i.e. status.desiredNumberScheduled) can have their pods stopped for an update at any given time. The update starts by stopping at most 30% of those DaemonSet pods and then brings up new DaemonSet pods in their place. Once the new pods are available, it then proceeds onto other DaemonSet pods, thus ensuring that at least 70% of original number of DaemonSet pods are available at all times during the update.
