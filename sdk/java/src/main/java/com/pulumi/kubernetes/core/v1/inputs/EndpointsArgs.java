/**
 * Endpoints is a collection of endpoints that implement the actual service. Example:
 * 
 *      Name: &#34;mysvc&#34;,
 *      Subsets: [
 *        {
 *          Addresses: [{&#34;ip&#34;: &#34;10.10.1.1&#34;}, {&#34;ip&#34;: &#34;10.10.2.2&#34;}],
 *          Ports: [{&#34;name&#34;: &#34;a&#34;, &#34;port&#34;: 8675}, {&#34;name&#34;: &#34;b&#34;, &#34;port&#34;: 309}]
 *        },
 *        {
 *          Addresses: [{&#34;ip&#34;: &#34;10.10.3.3&#34;}],
 *          Ports: [{&#34;name&#34;: &#34;a&#34;, &#34;port&#34;: 93}, {&#34;name&#34;: &#34;b&#34;, &#34;port&#34;: 76}]
 *        },
 *     ]
 * 
 * Endpoints is a legacy API and does not contain information about all Service features. Use discoveryv1.EndpointSlice for complete information about Service endpoints.
 * 
 * Deprecated: This API is deprecated in v1.33+. Use discoveryv1.EndpointSlice.
