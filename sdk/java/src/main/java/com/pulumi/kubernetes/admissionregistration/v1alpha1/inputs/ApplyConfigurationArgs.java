     * expression will be evaluated by CEL to create an apply configuration. ref: https://github.com/google/cel-spec
     * 
     * Apply configurations are declared in CEL using object initialization. For example, this CEL expression returns an apply configuration to set a single field:
     * 
     *     Object{
     *       spec: Object.spec{
     *         serviceAccountName: &#34;example&#34;
     *       }
     *     }
     * 
     * Apply configurations may not modify atomic structs, maps or arrays due to the risk of accidental deletion of values not included in the apply configuration.
     * 
     * CEL expressions have access to the object types needed to create apply configurations:
     * 
     * - &#39;Object&#39; - CEL type of the resource object. - &#39;Object.&lt;fieldName&gt;&#39; - CEL type of object field (such as &#39;Object.spec&#39;) - &#39;Object.&lt;fieldName1&gt;.&lt;fieldName2&gt;...&lt;fieldNameN&gt;` - CEL type of nested field (such as &#39;Object.spec.containers&#39;)
     * 
     * CEL expressions have access to the contents of the API request, organized into CEL variables as well as some other useful variables:
     * 
     * - &#39;object&#39; - The object from the incoming request. The value is null for DELETE requests. - &#39;oldObject&#39; - The existing object. The value is null for CREATE requests. - &#39;request&#39; - Attributes of the API request([ref](/pkg/apis/admission/types.go#AdmissionRequest)). - &#39;params&#39; - Parameter resource referred to by the policy binding being evaluated. Only populated if the policy has a ParamKind. - &#39;namespaceObject&#39; - The namespace object that the incoming object belongs to. The value is null for cluster-scoped resources. - &#39;variables&#39; - Map of composited variables, from its name to its lazily evaluated value.
     *   For example, a variable named &#39;foo&#39; can be accessed as &#39;variables.foo&#39;.
     * - &#39;authorizer&#39; - A CEL Authorizer. May be used to perform authorization checks for the principal (user or service account) of the request.
     *   See https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/cel/library#Authz
     * - &#39;authorizer.requestResource&#39; - A CEL ResourceCheck constructed from the &#39;authorizer&#39; and configured with the
     *   request resource.
     * 
     * The `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata.name` and `metadata.generateName` are always accessible from the root of the object. No other metadata properties are accessible.
     * 
     * Only property names of the form `[a-zA-Z_.-/][a-zA-Z0-9_.-/]*` are accessible. Required.
