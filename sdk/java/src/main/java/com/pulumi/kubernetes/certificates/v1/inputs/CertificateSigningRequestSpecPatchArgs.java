         *  2. Permitted subjects: and behavior when a disallowed subject is requested.
         *  3. Required, permitted, or forbidden x509 extensions in the request (including whether subjectAltNames are allowed, which types, restrictions on allowed values) and behavior when a disallowed extension is requested.
         *  4. Required, permitted, or forbidden key usages / extended key usages.
         *  5. Expiration/certificate lifetime: whether it is fixed by the signer, configurable by the admin.
         *  6. Whether or not requests for CA certificates are allowed.
