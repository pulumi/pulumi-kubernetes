Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object or EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is &#34;None&#34;, no virtual IP is allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather than a virtual IP. &#34;NodePort&#34; builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP. &#34;LoadBalancer&#34; builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP. &#34;ExternalName&#34; aliases this service to the specified externalName.
