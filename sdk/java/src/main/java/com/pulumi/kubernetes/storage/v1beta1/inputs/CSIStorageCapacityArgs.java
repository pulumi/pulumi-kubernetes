/**
 * CSIStorageCapacity stores the result of one CSI GetCapacity call. For a given StorageClass, this describes the available capacity in a particular topology segment.  This can be used when considering where to instantiate new PersistentVolumes.
 * 
 * For example this can express things like: - StorageClass &#34;standard&#34; has &#34;1234 GiB&#34; available in &#34;topology.kubernetes.io/zone=us-east1&#34; - StorageClass &#34;localssd&#34; has &#34;10 GiB&#34; available in &#34;kubernetes.io/hostname=knode-abc123&#34;
 * 
 * The following three cases all imply that no capacity is available for a certain combination: - no object exists with suitable topology and storage class name - such an object exists, but the capacity is unset - such an object exists, but the capacity is zero
 * 
 * The producer of these objects can decide which approach is more suitable.
 * 
 * They are consumed by the kube-scheduler when a CSI driver opts into capacity-aware scheduling with CSIDriverSpec.StorageCapacity. The scheduler compares the MaximumVolumeSize against the requested size of pending volumes to filter out unsuitable nodes. If MaximumVolumeSize is unset, it falls back to a comparison against the less precise Capacity. If that is also unset, the scheduler assumes that capacity is insufficient and tries some other node.
 *
