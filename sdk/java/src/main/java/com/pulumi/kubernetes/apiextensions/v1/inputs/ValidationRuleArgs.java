     * Rule represents the expression which will be evaluated by CEL. ref: https://github.com/google/cel-spec The Rule is scoped to the location of the x-kubernetes-validations extension in the schema. The `self` variable in the CEL expression is bound to the scoped value. Example: - Rule scoped to the root of a resource with a status subresource: {&#34;rule&#34;: &#34;self.status.actual &lt;= self.spec.maxDesired&#34;}
     * 
     * If the Rule is scoped to an object with properties, the accessible properties of the object are field selectable via `self.field` and field presence can be checked via `has(self.field)`. Null valued fields are treated as absent fields in CEL expressions. If the Rule is scoped to an object with additionalProperties (i.e. a map) the value of the map are accessible via `self[mapKey]`, map containment can be checked via `mapKey in self` and all entries of the map are accessible via CEL macros and functions such as `self.all(...)`. If the Rule is scoped to an array, the elements of the array are accessible via `self[i]` and also by macros and functions. If the Rule is scoped to a scalar, `self` is bound to the scalar value. Examples: - Rule scoped to a map of objects: {&#34;rule&#34;: &#34;self.components[&#39;Widget&#39;].priority &lt; 10&#34;} - Rule scoped to a list of integers: {&#34;rule&#34;: &#34;self.values.all(value, value &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; value &lt; 100)&#34;} - Rule scoped to a string value: {&#34;rule&#34;: &#34;self.startsWith(&#39;kube&#39;)&#34;}
     * 
     * The `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata.name` and `metadata.generateName` are always accessible from the root of the object and from any x-kubernetes-embedded-resource annotated objects. No other metadata properties are accessible.
     * 
     * Unknown data preserved in custom resources via x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields is not accessible in CEL expressions. This includes: - Unknown field values that are preserved by object schemas with x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields. - Object properties where the property schema is of an &#34;unknown type&#34;. An &#34;unknown type&#34; is recursively defined as:
     *   - A schema with no type and x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields set to true
     *   - An array where the items schema is of an &#34;unknown type&#34;
     *   - An object where the additionalProperties schema is of an &#34;unknown type&#34;
     * 
     * Only property names of the form `[a-zA-Z_.-/][a-zA-Z0-9_.-/]*` are accessible. Accessible property names are escaped according to the following rules when accessed in the expression: - &#39;__&#39; escapes to &#39;__underscores__&#39; - &#39;.&#39; escapes to &#39;__dot__&#39; - &#39;-&#39; escapes to &#39;__dash__&#39; - &#39;/&#39; escapes to &#39;__slash__&#39; - Property names that exactly match a CEL RESERVED keyword escape to &#39;__{keyword}__&#39;.

     * 	  &#34;true&#34;, &#34;false&#34;, &#34;null&#34;, &#34;in&#34;, &#34;as&#34;, &#34;break&#34;, &#34;const&#34;, &#34;continue&#34;, &#34;else&#34;, &#34;for&#34;, &#34;function&#34;, &#34;if&#34;,

     * Examples:
     *   - Rule accessing a property named &#34;namespace&#34;: {&#34;rule&#34;: &#34;self.__namespace__ &gt; 0&#34;}
     *   - Rule accessing a property named &#34;x-prop&#34;: {&#34;rule&#34;: &#34;self.x__dash__prop &gt; 0&#34;}
     *   - Rule accessing a property named &#34;redact__d&#34;: {&#34;rule&#34;: &#34;self.redact__underscores__d &gt; 0&#34;}
     * 
     * Equality on arrays with x-kubernetes-list-type of &#39;set&#39; or &#39;map&#39; ignores element order, i.e. [1, 2] == [2, 1]. Concatenation on arrays with x-kubernetes-list-type use the semantics of the list type:
     *   - &#39;set&#39;: `X + Y` performs a union where the array positions of all elements in `X` are preserved and
     *     non-intersecting elements in `Y` are appended, retaining their partial order.
     *   - &#39;map&#39;: `X + Y` performs a merge where the array positions of all keys in `X` are preserved but the values
     *     are overwritten by values in `Y` when the key sets of `X` and `Y` intersect. Elements in `Y` with
     *     non-intersecting keys are appended, retaining their partial order.
     * 
     * If `rule` makes use of the `oldSelf` variable it is implicitly a `transition rule`.
     * 
     * By default, the `oldSelf` variable is the same type as `self`. When `optionalOldSelf` is true, the `oldSelf` variable is a CEL optional
     *  variable whose value() is the same type as `self`.
     * See the documentation for the `optionalOldSelf` field for details.
     * 
     * Transition rules by default are applied only on UPDATE requests and are skipped if an old value could not be found. You can opt a transition rule into unconditional evaluation by setting `optionalOldSelf` to true.

Null valued fields are treated as absent fields in CEL expressions. If the Rule is scoped to an object with additionalProperties (i.e. a map) the value of the map are accessible via `self[mapKey]`, map containment can be checked via `mapKey in self` and all entries of the map are accessible via CEL macros and functions such as `self.all(...)`. If the Rule is scoped to an array, the elements of the array are accessible via `self[i]` and also by macros and functions. If the Rule is scoped to a scalar, `self` is bound to the scalar value.
