/**
 * EndpointSubset is a group of addresses with a common set of ports. The expanded set of endpoints is the Cartesian product of Addresses x Ports. For example, given:
 * 
 *     {
 *       Addresses: [{&#34;ip&#34;: &#34;10.10.1.1&#34;}, {&#34;ip&#34;: &#34;10.10.2.2&#34;}],
 *       Ports:     [{&#34;name&#34;: &#34;a&#34;, &#34;port&#34;: 8675}, {&#34;name&#34;: &#34;b&#34;, &#34;port&#34;: 309}]
 *     }
 * 
 * The resulting set of endpoints can be viewed as:
 * 
 *     a: [ 10.10.1.1:8675, 10.10.2.2:8675 ],
 *     b: [ 10.10.1.1:309, 10.10.2.2:309 ]
 * 
 * Deprecated: This API is deprecated in v1.33+.
