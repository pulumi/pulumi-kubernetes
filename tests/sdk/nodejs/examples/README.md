This folder contains a bunch of example programs that
are run as part of CI. Testing is mostly just to see
if they run without error. At some point we need to
see if they include any cases not covered by the
integration tests, and add the appropriate coverage
if not. Once that is done, we can add these to
the pulumi/examples repo or delete them.
